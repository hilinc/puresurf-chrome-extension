# Privacy Policy for PureSurf

**Last Updated: November 25, 2025**

## Data Collection

PureSurf does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing information.

## What the Extension Does

PureSurf operates entirely locally on your device to:

- Block cookie consent banners
- Remove privacy policy popups
- Hide intrusive overlays and modals

## Data Processing

All filtering and blocking happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers or third parties.

## Permissions Used

- **declarativeNetRequest**: Used to block unwanted content at the network level before it loads
- **host_permissions (<all_urls>)**: Required to apply blocking rules across all websites you visit

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of blocking intrusive popups and do not enable any data collection.

## Third-Party Services

PureSurf does not use any third-party services, analytics, tracking tools, or external APIs.

## Data Storage

No user data is stored locally or remotely. The extension only uses predefined blocking rules that are part of the extension package.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be updated on this page with a new "Last Updated" date.
